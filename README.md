## Quick Overview

**M**anjaro **L**ive **Q**uick **S**etup is a little shell package for automatizing my installation routine for Manjaro Live Linux. I don't think this will be useful for you, but you can play around with it and customize your own routines for live systems. I intent to expand the list of compatible Linux ditros (actually, this was developed for Arch Based Linux Distros, which uses Pacman for Package Managing).
It's important to say that this shell script file is very, very "just do it", without any error handler, connection check or anything like that, **but**, feel free to contribute (and maybe expand) this little project of mine.
